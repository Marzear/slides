todayilearned	eujcx	<p> a ballpoint pen , also known as a biro [ 1 ] ( british english ) , ball pen ( philippine english ) , or dot pen [ 2 ] ( nepali ) is a pen that dispenses ink ( usually in paste form ) over a metal ball at its point , i . e . over a " ball point " . the metal commonly used is steel , brass , or tungsten carbide . [ 3 ] the design was conceived and developed as a cleaner and more reliable alternative to dip pens and fountain pens , and it is now the world's most-used writing instrument ; [ 4 ] millions are manufactured and sold daily . [ 5 ] it has influenced art and graphic design and spawned an artwork genre .

todayilearned	eujcx	<h3> origins [ edit ] </h3>
todayilearned	eujcx	at left , an authentic birome made in argentina by bíró & meyne . at right , birome advertisement in argentine magazine leoplán , 1945 .
todayilearned	eujcx	<p> the concept of using a " ball point " within a writing instrument as a method of applying ink to paper has existed since the late 19th century . in these inventions , the ink was placed in a thin tube whose end was blocked by a tiny ball , held so that it could not slip into the tube or fall out of the pen .
todayilearned	eujcx	</p>
todayilearned	eujcx	<p> the first patent for a ballpoint pen [ 6 ] [ 7 ] was issued on 30 october 1888 to john j . loud , [8 ] who was attempting to make a writing instrument that would be able to write " on rough surfaces — such as wood , coarse wrapping-paper , and other articles " [ 9 ] which fountain pens could not . loud's pen had a small rotating steel ball , held in place by a socket . although it could be used to mark rough surfaces such as leather , as loud intended , it proved to be too coarse for letter-writing . with no commercial viability , its potential went unexploited [ 1 ] and the patent eventually lapsed . [ 10 ]
todayilearned	eujcx	</p>
todayilearned	eujcx	<p> the manufacture of economical , reliable ballpoint pens as are known today arose from experimentation , modern chemistry , and precision manufacturing capabilities of the early 20th century . [ 4 ] patents filed worldwide during early development are testaments to failed attempts at making the pens commercially viable and widely available . [ 11 ] early ballpoints did not deliver the ink evenly ; overflow and clogging were among the obstacles inventors faced toward developing reliable ballpoint pens . [ 5 ] if the ball socket was too tight , or the ink too thick , it would not reach the paper . if the socket was too loose , or the ink too thin , the pen would leak or the ink would smear . [ 5 ] ink reservoirs pressurized by piston , spring , capillary action , and gravity would all serve as solutions to ink-delivery and flow problems . [ 12 ] [ 13 ]
todayilearned	eujcx	</p>
todayilearned	eujcx	<p> lászló bíró , a hungarian newspaper editor ( later naturalized argentine ) frustrated by the amount of time that he wasted filling up fountain pens and cleaning up smudged pages , noticed that inks used in newspaper printing dried quickly , leaving the paper dry and smudge free . he decided to create a pen using the same type of ink . [ 5 ] bíró enlisted the help of his brother györgy , a dentist with a useful knowledge of chemistry , [ 14 ] to develop viscous ink formulae for new ballpoint designs . [ 4 ]
todayilearned	eujcx	</p>
todayilearned	eujcx	<p> bíró's innovation successfully coupled ink-viscosity with a ball-socket mechanism which acted compatibly to prevent ink from drying inside the reservoir while allowing controlled flow . [ 5 ] bíró filed a british patent on 15 june 1938 . [ 1 ] [ 15 ]
todayilearned	eujcx	</p>
todayilearned	eujcx	<p> in 1941 , the bíró brothers and a friend , juan jorge meyne , fled germany and moved to argentina , where they formed " bíró pens of argentina " and filed a new patent in 1943 . [ 1 ] their pen was sold in argentina as the " birome " from the names bíró and meyne , which is how ballpoint pens are still known in that country . [ 1 ] this new design was licensed by the british engineer frederick george miles and manufactured by his company miles aircraft , to be used by royal air force aircrew as the " biro " . [ 16 ] ballpoint pens were found to be more versatile than fountain pens , especially at high altitudes , where fountain pens were prone to leak . [ 5 ]
todayilearned	eujcx	</p>
todayilearned	eujcx	<p> bíró's patent , and other early patents on ballpoint pens , often used the term " ball-point fountain pen " . [ 17 ] [ self-published source ? ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ]

todayilearned	eujcx	<h3> postwar proliferation [ edit ] </h3>
todayilearned	eujcx	2018 parker jotters are similar to the version that first came out in 1954
todayilearned	eujcx	<p> following world war ii , many companies vied to commercially produce their own ballpoint pen design . in pre-war argentina , success of the birome ballpoint was limited , but in mid - 1945 , the eversharp co . , a maker of mechanical pencils , teamed up with eberhard faber co . to license the rights from birome for sales in the united states . [ 1 ] [ 10 ]
todayilearned	eujcx	</p>
todayilearned	eujcx	<p> in 1946 , a catalan firm , vila sivill hermanos , began to make a ballpoint , regia continua , and from 1953 to 1957 their factory also made bic ballpoints , on contract with the french firm société bic . [ 23 ]
todayilearned	eujcx	</p>
todayilearned	eujcx	<p> during the same period , american entrepreneur milton reynolds came across a birome ballpoint pen during a business trip to buenos aires , argentina . [ 1 ] [ 10 ] recognizing commercial potential , he purchased several ballpoint samples , returned to the united states , and founded the reynolds international pen company . reynolds bypassed the birome patent with sufficient design alterations to obtain an american patent , beating eversharp and other competitors to introduce the pen to the us market . [ 1 ] [ 10 ] debuting at gimbels department store in new york city on 29 october 1945 , [ 10 ] for us $ 12.50 each ( 1945 us dollar value , about $ 180 in 2020 dollars ) , [ 10 ] " reynolds rocket " became the first commercially successful ballpoint pen . [ 1 ] [ 5 ] [ 24 ] reynolds went to great extremes to market the pen , with great success ; gimbel's sold many thousands of pens within one week . in britain , the miles martin pen company was producing the first commercially successful ballpoint pens there by the end of 1945 . [ 1 ]
todayilearned	eujcx	</p>
todayilearned	eujcx	<p> neither reynolds ' nor eversharp's ballpoint lived up to consumer expectations in america . ballpoint pen sales peaked in 1946 , and consumer interest subsequently plunged due to market saturation . [ 10 ] by the early 1950s the ballpoint boom had subsided and reynolds ' company folded . [ 1 ]
todayilearned	eujcx	</p>
todayilearned	eujcx	<p> paper mate pens , among the emerging ballpoint brands of the 1950s , bought the rights to distribute their own ballpoint pens in canada . [ 25 ] facing concerns about ink-reliability , paper mate pioneered new ink formulas and advertised them as " banker-approved " . [ 10 ] in 1954 , parker pens released " the jotter " — the company's first ballpoint — boasting additional features and technological advances which also included the use of tungsten-carbide textured ball-bearings in their pens . [ 1 ] in less than a year , parker sold several million pens at prices between three and nine dollars . [ 1 ] in the 1960s , the failing eversharp co . sold its pen division to parker and ultimately folded . [ 1 ]
todayilearned	eujcx	</p>
todayilearned	eujcx	<p> marcel bich also introduced a ballpoint pen to the american marketplace in the 1950s , licensed from bíró and based on the argentine designs . [ 4 ] [ 26 ] bich shortened his name to bic in 1953 , forming the ballpoint brand bic now recognized globally . [ 5 ] bic pens struggled until the company launched its " writes the first time , every time ! " advertising campaign in the 1960s . [ 5 ] competition during this era forced unit prices to drop considerably . [ 5 ]
todayilearned	eujcx	</p>
todayilearned	eujcx	<h2> inks [ edit ] </h2>
todayilearned	eujcx	<p> ballpoint pen ink is normally a paste containing around 25 to 40 percent dye . the dyes are suspended in a mixture of solvents and fatty acids . [ 27 ] the most common of the solvents are benzyl alcohol or phenoxyethanol , which mix with the dyes and oils to create a smooth paste that dries quickly . the fatty acids help to lubricate the ball tip while writing . hybrid inks also contain added lubricants in the ink to provide a smoother writing experience . [ 27 ] the drying time of the ink varies depending upon the viscosity of the ink and the diameter of the ball .
todayilearned	eujcx	</p>
todayilearned	eujcx	<p> in general , the more viscous the ink , the faster it will dry , but more writing pressure needs to be applied to dispense ink . but although they are less viscous , hybrid inks have a faster drying time compared to normal ballpoint inks . also , a larger ball dispenses more ink and thus increases drying time .
todayilearned	eujcx	</p>
todayilearned	eujcx	<p> the dyes used in blue and black ballpoint pens are basic dyes based on triarylmethane and acid dyes derived from diazo compounds or phthalocyanine . common dyes in blue ( and black ) ink are prussian blue , victoria blue , methyl violet , crystal violet , and phthalocyanine blue . the dye eosin is commonly used for red ink .
todayilearned	eujcx	</p>
todayilearned	eujcx	<p> the inks are resistant to water after drying but can be defaced by certain solvents which include acetone and various alcohols .

todayilearned	eujcx	commonly used ballpoint refill types ( diameter and length given in millimeters )
todayilearned	eujcx	<p> ballpoint pens are produced in both disposable and refillable models . refills allow for the entire internal ink reservoir , including a ballpoint and socket , to be replaced . such characteristics are usually associated with designer-type pens or those constructed of finer materials . the simplest types of ballpoint pens are disposable and have a cap to cover the tip when the pen is not in use , or a mechanism for retracting the tip , [ 4 ] which varies between manufacturers but is usually a spring - or screw-mechanism .
todayilearned	eujcx	</p>
todayilearned	eujcx	<p> rollerball pens employ the same ballpoint mechanics , but with the use of water-based inks instead of oil-based inks . [ 28 ] compared to oil-based ballpoints , rollerball pens are said to provide more fluid ink-flow , but the water-based inks will blot if held stationary against the writing surface . water-based inks also remain wet longer when freshly applied and are thus prone to " smearing " — posing problems to left-handed people ( or right handed people writing right-to-left script ) — and " running " , should the writing surface become wet .
todayilearned	eujcx	</p>
todayilearned	eujcx	<p> some ballpoint pens use a hybrid ink formulation whose viscosity is lower than that of standard ballpoint ink , but greater than rollerball ink . [ 27 ] the ink dries faster than a gel pen to prevent smearing when writing . these pens are better suited for left-handed persons . examples are the uni-ball jetstream and pilot acroball ranges . [ 29 ] these pens are also labelled " extra smooth " , as they offer a smoother writing experience compared to normal ballpoint pens .
todayilearned	eujcx	</p>
todayilearned	eujcx	<p> because of a ballpoint pen's reliance on gravity to coat the ball with ink , most cannot be used to write upside-down . however , technology developed by fisher pens in the united states resulted in the production of what came to be known as the " fisher space pen " . space pens combine a more viscous ink with a pressurized ink reservoir [ 5 ] that forces the ink toward the point . unlike standard ballpoints , the rear end of a space pen's pressurized reservoir is sealed , eliminating evaporation and leakage , [ 5 ] thus allowing the pen to write upside-down , in zero-gravity environments , and reportedly underwater . [ 30 ] astronauts have made use of these pens in outer space . [ 5 ]
todayilearned	eujcx	</p>
todayilearned	eujcx	<p> ballpoint pens with erasable ink were pioneered by the paper mate pen company . [ 31 ] the ink formulas of erasable ballpoints have properties similar to rubber cement , allowing the ink to be literally rubbed clean from the writing surface before drying and eventually becoming permanent . [ 31 ] erasable ink is much thicker than standard ballpoint inks , requiring pressurized cartridges to facilitate inkflow — meaning they can also write upside-down . though these pens are equipped with erasers , any eraser will suffice . [ 31 ]
todayilearned	eujcx	</p>
todayilearned	eujcx	<p> the inexpensive , disposable bic cristal ( also simply " bic pen " or " biro " ) is reportedly the most widely sold pen in the world . [ 26 ] [ 32 ] it was the bic company's first product and is still synonymous with the company name . [ 33 ] [ 34 ] the bic cristal is part of the permanent collection at the museum of modern art in new york city , acknowledged for its industrial design . [ 35 ] [ 32 ] its hexagonal barrel mimics that of a wooden pencil and is transparent , showing the ink level in the reservoir . originally a sealed streamlined cap , the modern pen cap has a small hole at the top to meet safety standards , helping to prevent suffocation if children suck it into the throat . [ 36 ]

todayilearned	eujcx	<p> multi-pens are pens that feature multiple varying colored pen refills . sometimes ballpoint refills are combined with another non-ballpoint refill , usually a mechanical pencil . sometimes ballpoint pens combine a ballpoint tip on one end and touchscreen stylus on the other .
todayilearned	eujcx	</p>
todayilearned	eujcx	<p> ballpoint pens are sometimes provided free by businesses , such as hotels and banks , printed with a company's name and logo . ballpoints have also been produced to commemorate events , such as a pen commemorating the 1963 assassination of president john f . kennedy . [ 4 ] these pens , known as " advertising pens , " are the same as standard ballpoint pen models , but have become valued among collectors .
todayilearned	eujcx	</p>
todayilearned	eujcx	<p> sometimes ballpoint pens are also produced as design objects . with cases made of metal or wood , they become individually styled utility objects .

todayilearned	eujcx	<p> ballpoint pens have proven to be a versatile art medium for professional artists as well as amateur doodlers . [ 37 ] low cost , availability , and portability are cited by practitioners as qualities which make this common writing tool a convenient , alternative art supply . [ 38 ] some artists use them within mixed-media works , while others use them solely as their medium-of-choice . [ 39 ]
todayilearned	eujcx	</p>
todayilearned	eujcx	<p> effects not generally associated with ballpoint pens can be achieved . [ 40 ] traditional pen-and-ink techniques such as stippling and cross-hatching can be used to create half-tones [ 41 ] or the illusion of form and volume . [ 42 ] for artists whose interests necessitate precision line-work , ballpoints are an obvious attraction ; ballpoint pens allow for sharp lines not as effectively executed using a brush . [ 43 ] finely applied , the resulting imagery has been mistaken for airbrushed artwork [ 44 ] and photography , [ 45 ] causing reactions of disbelief which ballpoint artist lennie mace refers to as the " wow factor " . [ 43 ] [ 44 ]
todayilearned	eujcx	</p>
todayilearned	eujcx	<p> famous 20th - century artists such as andy warhol , among others , have utilized ballpoint pens to some extent during their careers . [ 46 ] ballpoint pen artwork continues to attract interest in the 21st century , with contemporary artists gaining recognition for their specific use of ballpoint pens ; for their technical proficiency , imagination , and innovation . korean-american artist il lee has been creating large-scale , ballpoint-only abstract artwork since the late 1970s . [ 37 ] since the 1980s , lennie mace creates imaginative , ballpoint-only artwork of varying content and complexity , applied to unconventional surfaces including wood and denim . [ 47 ] the artist coined terms such as " pentings " and " media graffiti " to describe his varied output . [ 43 ] more recently , british artist james mylne has been creating photo-realistic artwork using mostly black ballpoints , sometimes with minimal mixed-media color . [ 45 ]
todayilearned	eujcx	</p>
todayilearned	eujcx	<p> using ballpoint pens to create artwork is not without limitations . color availability and sensitivity of ink to light are among concerns of ballpoint pen artists . [ 48 ] mistakes pose greater risks to ballpoint artists ; once a line is drawn , it generally cannot be erased . [ 43 ] additionally , " blobbing " of ink on the drawing surface and " skipping " of ink-flow require consideration when using ballpoint pens for artistic purposes . [ 39 ] although the mechanics of ballpoint pens remain relatively unchanged , ink composition has evolved to solve certain problems over the years , resulting in unpredictable sensitivity to light and some extent of fading . [ 48 ]

todayilearned	eujcx	<h2> manufacturing [ edit ] </h2>
todayilearned	eujcx	the ink holder of a disposable ballpoint pen
todayilearned	eujcx	<p> although designs and construction vary between brands , basic components of all ballpoint pens are universal . [ 4 ] standard components of a ballpoint tip include the freely rotating " ball " itself ( distributing the ink on the writing surface ) , a " socket " holding the ball in place , small " ink channels " that provide ink to the ball through the socket , and a self-contained " ink reservoir " supplying ink to the ball . [ 5 ] in modern disposable pens , narrow plastic tubes contain the ink , which is compelled downward to the ball by gravity . [ 5 ] brass , steel , or tungsten carbide are used to manufacture the ball bearing-like points , [ 5 ] then housed in a brass socket . [ 49 ]
todayilearned	eujcx	</p>
todayilearned	eujcx	<p> the function of these components can be compared with the ball-applicator of roll-on antiperspirant ; the same technology at a larger scale . the ballpoint tip delivers the ink to the writing surface while acting as a " buffer " between the ink in the reservoir and the air outside , preventing the quick-drying ink from drying inside the reservoir . modern ballpoints are said to have a two-year shelf life , on average . [ 5 ]
todayilearned	eujcx	</p>
todayilearned	eujcx	<p> a ballpoint tip that can write comfortably for a long period of time is not easy to produce , as it requires high-precision machinery and thin high-grade steel alloy plates . china , which as of 2017 [ update ] produces about 80 percent of the world's ballpoint pens , relied on imported ballpoint tips and metal alloys before 2017 . [ 50 ]
todayilearned	eujcx	</p>
todayilearned	eujcx	<p> the common ballpoint pen is a product of mass production , with components produced separately on assembly lines . [ 49 ] basic steps in the manufacturing process include the production of ink formulas , molding of metal and plastic components , and assembly . [ 4 ] marcel bich was involved in developing the production of inexpensive ballpoint pens . [ 5 ]
